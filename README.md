# Health-Insurance-Cost-Prediction
Introduction

In the health insurance industry, data analytic is an important process that helps insurers to identify and predict the cost of health insurance which prevents risk and cost for the companies. The Insurance data set contains 1338 observations and 7 variables which include age, sex, children, smoker, region, and expenses.

The description of the data set is as below:
Age: Age of primary beneficiary
Sex: Primary beneficiary’s gender
BMI: Body mass index (providing an understanding of the body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height)
Children: Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents
Smoker: Smoking (yes, no)
Region: Beneficiary’s residential area in the US (northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest)
Expenses: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance.

In order for a health insurance company to make money, it needs to collect more in yearly premiums than it spends on medical care to its beneficiaries. As a result, insurers invest a great deal of time and money in developing models that accurately forecast medical expenses for the insured population. The goal of this analysis is to use patient data to estimate the average medical care expenses for such population segments. It is important to give some thought to how these variables may be related to billed medical expenses. For example, we might expect that older people and smokers are at higher risk of large medical expenses. Unlike many other machine learning methods, in regression analysis, the relationships among the features are typically specified by the user rather than being detected automatically. We’ll explore some of these potential relationships in the next section.
