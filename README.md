# Health Insurance Cost Prediction
## Introduction
In the health insurance industry, data analytics plays a crucial role in identifying and predicting the cost of insurance, helping companies mitigate risks and manage expenses effectively. This project utilizes a dataset containing 1338 observations and 7 variables to predict individual medical costs billed by health insurance.

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes the following variables:

- Age: Age of the primary beneficiary.
- Sex: Gender of the primary beneficiary.
- BMI: Body mass index, which provides insights into whether a personâ€™s weight is high or low relative to their height.
- Children: Number of dependents covered by the health insurance plan.
- Smoker: Whether the beneficiary is a smoker (yes or no).
- Region: The beneficiary's residential area in the U.S. (northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest).
- Expenses: Individual medical costs billed by the insurance company.
## Project Objective
For health insurance companies to remain profitable, they must accurately forecast the medical expenses of their insured population. By analyzing patient data, we aim to estimate the average medical care costs for different population segments. This project focuses on exploring the relationships between features such as age, smoking status, BMI, and medical costs, which are crucial for predicting health insurance expenses.

## Methodology
Using regression analysis, we model the relationships between the predictor variables (e.g., age, smoker status, BMI) and the target variable (medical expenses). Unlike other machine learning methods, regression analysis requires users to specify the relationships among features rather than having them detected automatically by the model. The analysis investigates potential relationships, such as whether older individuals and smokers have higher medical costs.
